                            <p className='about-text'>Hi! I am Hafiz. I love doing frontend development. I started getting into IT about 8 years ago when I enrolled in Singapore Polytechnic in IT Security course. After that I continued studying in the same field in Singapore Institute of Technology. After graduation, I found a job as a website pentester.</p>
                            <p className='about-text' style={{fontWeight:"bold"}}>A Change of Heart</p>
                            <div className="card-divider"></div>
                            <p className='about-text'>After some time being a pentester, I realise that I love building things and not breaking them down. So I tried doing Python as a job, since I am already used to using Python. I found a job as a backend developer. However, I realise that I have much more to learn about website development. Soon after, I enrolled in a web development course in Trent Global, which offers a Diploma.</p>

                            <div className="card-divider"></div>
                            <p className='about-text'>While in Trent Global, I was exposed to fullstack development. However, I realised that I love doing frontend and I like doing design and meeting user experience needs. Being detail-oriented in nature, I would spent many hours to perfect the design and visuals of the website. Being a creative person, I like to experiment with things so that the website will look impressive. I am looking forward to new projects with you!</p>
